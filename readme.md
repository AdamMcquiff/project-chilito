## Project Chilito

#### What is Project Chilito


API codebase. Project Chilito is a small project I brewed up after experiencing frustrations with eBay's stock management system, which I found to be clunky, feature-lacking and difficult.

Project Chilito is the solution to those frustrations. Project Chilito is an inventory management system that links to eBay, creating a more fluid, easier experience for eBay sellers. Project Chilito is an API that can be used for front-end applications across all platforms (Web, iOS, Android, etc.).
